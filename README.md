# Python Exercises - IAC Weeks 2 - 5

This repository contains the Python Walkthrough code examples and exercises for Weeks 2 to 5 of the Module Infrastructure as Code (IAC) completed as part of the PG Dip in Cloud Computing Semester Block 1 2022.
The following versions of 
Language: Python 3.10.8
Visual Studio Code version 1.71.2
OS: Windows or Linux.
The use of the cheatsheet
The code was stored locally on the student’s OneDrive C:\Users\leooc\OneDrive - Atlantic TU\IAC Assignment 2\Python and then pushed up to this GitHub repo.
A .gitignore file was created on GitHub to exclude complied Pythion (.pyc extension) files. This new file was then pulled to the local repo using git pull.
Branching
A Dev and Test branch were created in the repo on GitHub. A new file called test_branching was created to display a test merge of changes from the dev branch to the main branch.
Changes made here were then merged back to the local repo. It should be noted that changes could have been equally validly made on the local machine and pushed live to GitHub using the commands ‘Branching Specific Commands’ in the cheatsheet.
