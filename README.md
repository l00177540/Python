# Python Exercises - IAC Weeks 2 - 5 #

This repository contains the Python Walkthrough code examples and exercises for Weeks 2 to 5 of the Module Infrastructure as Code (IAC) completed as part of the PG Dip in Cloud Computing Semester Block 1 2022.

## Software Used

The following versions of software were used:

Language: Python 3.10.8  
Visual Studio Code version 1.71.2  
OS: Windows or Linux.  

## Repo Description   

The code in the Exercise_1 to Exercise_12 folders are presented to illustrate the work done in this module to gain a familiarity of Python which was the primary focus of Report 1 and 2 and also subsequently in Assignment 1 of the IAC module.   

The cheatsheet created in the IAC module Report 3 for Git and GitHub was found to be useful for this assignment, and is also included in the repo as GIT Cheatsheet.xlsx

The code was stored locally on the student’s OneDrive C:\Users\leooc\OneDrive - Atlantic TU\IAC Assignment 2\Python and then pushed up to this GitHub repo.

A .gitignore file was created on GitHub to exclude complied Python (.pyc extension) files. This new file was then pulled to the local repo using git pull.
Because the repo was originally uploaded to GitHub without a gitignore file, the file had to be applied by using these commands:

*git rm -r --cached .*      
*git add .*       
*git commit -m "Apply new gitignore file"*             

This deleted files such as those stored in the --pycache-- system folders. Once this was done locally, a git push was run to sync the Github repo.

## Branching

A Dev and Test branch were created in the repo on GitHub. A new file called test_branching was created to display a test merge of changes from the dev branch to the main branch. Changes made here were then merged back to the local repo. It should be noted that changes could have been equally validly made on the local machine and pushed live to GitHub using the commands ‘Branching Specific Commands’ in the cheatsheet.
