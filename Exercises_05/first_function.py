If the function is called as shown below in the final line of code with no brackets, there is no output
Explanation of why from: From https://www.edlitera.com/blog/posts/python-parentheses
"Parentheses are necessary when you want to invoke functions. 
Calling on the name of a function without following it by parentheses will point towards the function object, 
but will not call the function itself. The code inside the body of the function will not get executed."
